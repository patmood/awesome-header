# Awesome Header

##[DEMO](http://patmood.github.io/awesome-header)

This effect is inspired by the Android 5.0 contact screen. I wanted to try my hand at implementing it as a jQuery plugin.

Create a pull request or github issue if you've got any suggestions or ideas for improvement!

I'd like to move as much as possible from javascript to CSS.
